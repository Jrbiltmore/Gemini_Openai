# Monitoring Stack Setup

## 1. Metrics Collection with Prometheus
- **Prometheus Configuration**: Set up to scrape metrics from your application, database, and services.
- **Exporters**: Use exporters for PostgreSQL, Redis, and the operating system.

### Example Prometheus Configuration (`prometheus.yml`):
```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'application'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8000']  # Replace with your application endpoint
  
  - job_name: 'postgres'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9187']  # Replace with your PostgreSQL exporter endpoint
  
  - job_name: 'redis'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9121']  # Replace with your Redis exporter endpoint
```

## 2. Visualizing Metrics with Grafana
- **Integrate with Prometheus**: Configure Grafana to use Prometheus as a data source.
- **Create Dashboards**: Set up dashboards for application performance, database health, and system resource usage.

## 3. Centralized Logging with ELK Stack
- **Elasticsearch**: Store and index log data.
- **Logstash**: Collect and process log data from various sources.
- **Kibana**: Visualize and analyze logs.

## 4. Alerting with Prometheus and Grafana
- **Prometheus Alertmanager**: Handle alerts based on predefined thresholds.
- **Grafana Alerts**: Trigger alerts for critical metrics.

## 5. System Health Monitoring
- **Systemd Service Monitoring**: Ensure services are monitored and auto-restart if they fail.
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Ensure application accessibility and responsiveness.

## 6. Anomaly Detection
- **Anomaly Detection Tools**: Implement tools to identify unusual patterns in metrics or logs.
